Place your tab bar icons here.

Required files (recommended sizes 24x24 or 28x28):
- home.png
- home-focused.png
- search.png
- search-focused.png
- share.png
- share-focused.png
- favorite.png
- favorite-focused.png

Optional retina variants (recommended):
- home@2x.png, home@3x.png, etc.

Notes:
- Files must be PNG (or other raster format supported by React Native Image) and located exactly at `src/assets/icons/<name>.png`.
- The app falls back to MaterialIcons if an image is missing.
- To generate icons quickly, you can export from your design tool at the recommended sizes and place them here.
